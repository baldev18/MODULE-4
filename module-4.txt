1. Explain how the Navigator widget works in Flutter.
The Navigator widget in Flutter is used to move between different screens in an app.
Flutter uses a stack system for navigation. Think of it like a stack of books:
When you open a new screen, it is pushed on top of the stack.
When you go back, the current screen is popped off the stack.
Important Navigator methods:

Navigator.push() → Opens a new screen.

Navigator.pop() → Goes back to the previous screen.

Navigator.pushReplacement() → Replaces the current screen.

Example:
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
);


To go back:
Navigator.pop(context);


2. Describe the concept of named routes and their advantages over direct route navigation.
What are Named Routes?
Named routes allow you to define routes using names instead of directly calling the screen widget.

Example:
routes: {
  '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
  '/products': (context) => ProductScreen(),
}

Navigate using:
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/products');
Advantages of Named Routes:


3. Explain how data can be passed between screens using route arguments.
In Flutter, we can pass data from one screen to another using arguments.

Example:
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => DetailsScreen(productName: "Shoes"),
  ),
);

Then receive in second screen:

class DetailsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final String productName;

  DetailsScreen({required this.productName});
}
